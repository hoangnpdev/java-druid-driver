# Apache Druid (0.9.2) Java library 
Java library designed to simplify data requests from Apache Druid 0.9.2:
- using Java syntax instead of JSON strings, this library helps reduce boilerplate code and makes it easier to maintain your codebase
- support for mapping the response result to Java objects, specifically JavaBeans. This allows for a more intuitive and seamless integration of Druid data into your Java application.
